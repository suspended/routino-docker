# Routino + Docker
ðŸš¢ Docker container for the Routino routing server

Run `docker build -t routino .` to spin up a Docker container with Routino.

Head over to `<docker-ip>:<docker-port>/routino/www/routino/` to explore the default UI. If you want to work with the Routino API, you might want to check out the `router.cgi` endpoint which the Routino UI uses as well.
